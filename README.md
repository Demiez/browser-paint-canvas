## Browser paint with Canvas use on React

### `>>>`
1) Created react app with use of create-react-app
2) Changed favicon, removed default react adjustments
3) Created markup with use of react elements in app.js
4) Added some styles to app.css
5) Added graffiti and circle(only on mousedown event)


### planned functionality
- resize circles on canvas in runtime (will need to check how to calculate distance between two points in canvas)
- draw lines
- draw rectangles
- undo button
- delete button (a user should select an element, it should be highlighted, after clicking on the button user has to be able to delete it)
